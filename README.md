# Hi, Im Hudson

I am a developer working for [REA](https://www.rea-group.com/) who is enthusiastic about all things code.

Proficient in both front and backend programming, I have a wide range of knowledge from across different programming languages, paradigms, and libraries.

I enjoy taking an idea from conception to its final form, and place great emphasis on the quality of the code I produce, from the code, tests and documentation.
